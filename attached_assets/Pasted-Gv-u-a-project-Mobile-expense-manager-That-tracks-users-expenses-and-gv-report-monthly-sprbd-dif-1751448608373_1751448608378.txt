🧪 Test with common receipts (Uber, restaurants, e-commerce, supermarkets)

📥 Email Parsing (Forward-to-App)
Option 1 (No-code): Use Mailparser → Zapier → Xano

Setup template to extract:

Merchant

Total

Date

Items

Option 2 (Custom): Xano + IMAP fetcher

Parse incoming emails to user-tagged mailbox

Extract and push to DB
