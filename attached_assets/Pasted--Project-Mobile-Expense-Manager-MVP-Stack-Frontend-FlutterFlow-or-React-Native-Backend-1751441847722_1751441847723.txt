Store name

Date

Amount

Category (based on merchant or keywords)

Data is auto-saved in Xano’s database with file upload URL

🧪 Test with common receipts (Uber, restaurants, e-commerce, supermarkets)

Option 1 (No-code): Use Mailparser → Zapier → Xano

Setup template to extract:

Option 2 (Custom): Xano + IMAP fetcher

Parse incoming emails to user-tagged mailbox
